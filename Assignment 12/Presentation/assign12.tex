	\begin{frame}{Question}
	Suppose that the time between arrvals of patients in a dentist's office constitutes samples of 
	a random variable X with density $ {\theta}e^{-{\theta}x}U(x) $. The 40th patient arrived 4 hours after the first. 
	Find the 0.95 confidence interval of the mean arrival time $ {\eta}=\dfrac{1}{{\theta}} $
	
	\end{frame}
	
	
	% Blocks frame
	\section{Solution}
	\begin{frame}{Solution}
	The time of arrival of the 40th patient is the sum $ x_{1} +x_{2} +..... + x_{n} $ of 
	$ n=39 $ RVs with exponential distribution.\\
	\medskip
	We can estimate the mean 
	$ {\eta}=\dfrac{1}{{\theta}} $ of $  x $ in terms of its sample mean $  X=\dfrac{240}{39}=6.15  $
	minutes using Normal Approximation method.  \\
	\medskip
	Taking {$\lambda$}={$\eta$} and $ z_{0.975} $/{$\sqrt{39}$}=0.315\\
	\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
	\begin{align}
		P\left\{\dfrac{\overline{x}}{1.315}\ < {\eta} < \dfrac{\overline{x}}{0.685}\right\}= 0.95 \\
		\implies 4.68minutes  < {\eta} < 8.98minutes
	\end{align}
